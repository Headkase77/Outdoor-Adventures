Outdoor Adventures - CS145 Web Design Final - By Joshua Spillers and Tyler Gordon

Welcome to Outdoor Adventures. We want to thank you for taking a 
    look at our Final Project for this class.

We set out on some pretty ambitious endeavors on this project and wanted to 
    take a moment to navigate some of our choices.

    On the blog page you will see several boxes that allow you to read "blog" posts on our website. 
        If the link is clicked, it will take you to a "Site Contruction" page. 
    
    This page contains the navigation bar and will take you back to the main site.

    Our locations page does contain some minor functionality. 
        Please enter Montana, or Alaska in the search bar and see some available "Adventures" pop up in a list format. 
    
    The intent behind this page is that each adventure that pops up would contain
        a link allowing the site visitor to be taken to the site of a company that would be "contracting" with us. 
    
    Embedded cookies and site tracking would allow the contractor to know where the 
        customer came from and discount pricing would be available for the customer. 
    
    We had originally intended for this to also contain the Google Maps API, but that proved to be far out of the scope
        of our skillset.

    Lastly, our Employment page will allow you to click on either of the three fields 
        (These are just basic, and a real site would contain far more option), 
        and will provide some brief information about the field and a "Submit Application" button. 
    
    If you click this button, it will take you to a sign in page. 
    
    This page has some unique functionality but doesn't do anything of substance.
    
    Feel free to click on the sign in, or sign up buttons to see the funcationality. 

Note: We would like it to be known that all of the code and programming for the login page did come 
    from ASMR Prog on YouTube, from their GitHub page. 
We changed the colors to match the color scheme of our website.
